        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, if you use the Services to connect with third-party
        services that you authorize us to use information from and about you, on
        your behalf, to interact with these third-party services based on your
        requests.
      </p>
      <h3>B. How We Use Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
      <p>
        We may use third parties to measure and target advertisements for us
        about our products and services that are tailored to your online
        interests. We allow these third-party companies to use cookies, web
        beacons, pixel tags and similar technologies to collect certain data and
        other information about your online activity. This information is used
        to display advertisements for Sunternal on the Services or across other
        websites, mobile applications, social media or online services that you
        use.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also may display interest-based ads through Facebook, Twitter, or
        other social media platforms or websites. This is done through the
        Facebook Custom Audiences, Twitter Tailor Audiences, or other similar
        business tools. These tools allow us to personalize our ads based on
        your shopping experience with us, without having to share your personal
        information with these social media platforms. We do this only by
        sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to
        a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform
        then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of
        serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike
        audiences). The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted and are
        not used for any other purpose.
        <br />
        <br />
        For information on your choices with respect to interest-based ads, see
        the “Interest Based Advertising Choices” section below.

      <h3>C. Unsubscribing from Our Marketing Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We provide our customers, as well as individuals referred by our
        customers, with the opportunity to opt out of having their information
        used for purposes not directly related to placement, processing,
        fulfillment, or delivery of a product or service.
        <br />
        <br />
        To opt out of marketing communications or to request to be added to our
        Do Not Call List or Do Not Mail List, you may use one of these
        convenient methods:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <u>Email Offers</u>: If you receive commercial email from us, you may
        unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within
        the email, or by sending us an email or writing to us at the addresses
        listed below. You should note that unsubscribing from our emails will
        not automatically unsubscribe you from emails sent by any third party,
        and you will need to separately unsubscribe from such third party’s
        communication, if desired.
        <br />
        <u>Direct Mail Offers</u>: If you do not wish to be notified by postal
        mail regarding products, services, events, programs, and offers that we
        believe you may find of interest, send us an email or write to us at the
        addresses listed below.
        <br />
        <u>Telemarketing</u>: If you do not want to receive marketing phone
        calls from us, you may: (i) email us at info@Ca-energy.org with “Do Not
        Call” in the subject line; (ii) ask to be placed on our Do Not Call list
        when you receive a call from us; or (iv) mail us at the address listed
        below. Once we place your name on our internal “Do Not Call” list, we
        will no longer call you for marketing purposes (unless you submit
        another inquiry or request another consultation/quote from us after your
        initial do-not-call request). We will honor your request as soon as
        reasonably possible. You may still receive calls from third parties who
        are not calling on our behalf regarding their products and services, and
        you will need to separately request that those parties not call you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive marketing communications from one or more of our
        affiliates or subsidiaries, you must opt out individually from each of
        the brands from which you are receiving brand-specific marketing
        communications.
      </p>
      <h3>D. With Respect to Other Third-Party Communications</h3>
      <p>
        Any third parties to whom we may disclose your information may have
        their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose your
        information, and your choices. If you want to learn more about their
        privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third
        parties.
      </p>
      <h2>5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>
        Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the
        Services to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from,
        children under the age of thirteen. If we learn that a child under the
        age of thirteen has provided personally identifiable information to the
        Services, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from
        our files as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <h2>6. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND PLUG-INS</h2>
      <p>
        The Services may contain links to third parties who partner with us. If
        you use those links, these third parties may collect information about
        you. We do not control third-party links or how these third parties
        collect and use your personal information. If you have any questions
        about their privacy practices, you should view their privacy policies
        and/or contact those third parties directly.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services also may offer you the ability to interact with social
        plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social
        media site to receive data from or about you. In some cases, we may know
        that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Facebook Follow button,
        or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if
        you have previously provided personal information to a third party
        operating a plug-in on the Services, then such third party may recognize
        you on the Services. Your use of social network plugins is subject to
        each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from
        ours, so please read these policies carefully to understand their
        policies and your options. As with linked sites, we have no control over

      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>
        The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights
        regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA
        rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
      </p>
      <h3>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to
        you about our collection and use of your personal information over the
        past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer

        called a data portability request).
      </p>
      <h3>Deletion Request Rights</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
        information we collected from you and retained, subject to certain
        exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
        request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete)
        your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is
        necessary for us or our service providers to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal
          information, provide a good or service that you requested, take

          business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with
          you.

          Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or
          statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other
          applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion
          may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s
          achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
      <p>
        To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described
        above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by email at
        info@CA Energy.org
      </p>
      <p>
        Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State
        that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
        request related to your personal information. You may also make a
        verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
        portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
        request must:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you
        are the person about whom we collected personal information or an
        authorized representative.
        <br />
        <br />
        Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
        understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
        information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
        request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a
        verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account
        with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable
        consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make
        the request.
      </p>
      <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>
      <p>
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days
        of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform
        you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an
        account with us, we will deliver our written response to the registered
        email associated with the account. If you do not have an account with
        us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at
        your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month
        period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response
        we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
        request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a
        format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and
        should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
        entity without hindrance.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
        request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If
        we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we
        made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
        completing your request.
      </p>
